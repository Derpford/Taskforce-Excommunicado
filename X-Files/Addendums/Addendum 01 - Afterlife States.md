### The Eternal Ballroom

The Eternal Ballroom is a series of large meeting halls or ballrooms. Consistent details include:
- Chandeliers that do not appear to be supported by anything;
- Marble-tiled floors;
- Echoing, distant laughter;
- Faceless dancers;
- Spatial distortion, typically in the form of the ballroom "going on forever" or looping back on itself.

Witnesses describe feeling an urge to dance, joining other 'guests'. The dance as described is a waltz, and witness statements suggest that even those who have not practiced dancing find themselves able to keep up easily. Another consistent detail is the complete lack of music; despite this, the 'guests' are always described as keeping perfect rhythm with each other, and witnesses also describe being able to keep time with ease regardless of prior musical or dancing experience.

Some witnesses describe the dancers as desperate or confused. The theory that the 'guests' want to leave, but can't, is commonly raised by witnesses.

### The Library of Almina 

The Library of Almina is an unusually large library, built in a gothic style. Consistent details include:
- Shelves that stretch to infinity both horizontally and vertically;
- Books that contain large amounts of information about any subject one looks for;
- A sense of stillness and timelessness;
- Dim lighting;
- An overwhelming sense of loneliness.

No other beings appear in the Library. Despite describing vast amounts of knowledge available within the Library, witnesses typically fail to recall most details about what they learned while in the Library.

### The White Halls

The White Halls are an abstract space filled with visions of past events in one's life. Consistent details include:
- Memories from one's childhood;
- Scenes of family gatherings, at home, at restaurants, and at other social events;
- A focus on mundane parts of the agent's life;
- Locations that appear to be a collage of previous experiences;
- Rough approximations of one's family members or close friends.

Witnesses describe the White Halls as being 'uncanny', 'like a Hallmark movie about \[their\] own life', etc.; while the surface-level appearance is that of a nostalgic trip down memory lane, nearly all Agents who visit the White Halls report being disturbed by the presence of minor inaccuracies, suggesting that the scenes were constructed by something (rather than being pulled directly from one's mind).

### The Forest

The Forest is an evergreen forest. Consistent details include:
- Large, healthy trees;
- Verdant undergrowth;
- Distant birdsong;
- Beautiful scenery;
- Pleasant weather.

Despite the idyllic descriptions given by witnesses, all witnesses reported feeling as though they were being hunted by something.

### The Farms

The Farms are a rural community that spans multiple time periods. Common details include:
- Agricultural laborers from multiple time periods;
- Farm equipment and produce from multiple time periods;
- Large communal meals and gatherings;
- Witnesses being asked to perform labor on these farms;
- A sense of stagnation.

Witness accounts commonly describe finding the experience comforting, but also stifling. Many witnesses describe spending weeks or months in The Farms, whereas witnesses to other afterlifes often describe the duration of their stay in hours or even minutes.

### The Waiting Room

The Waiting Room is a small office waiting room. Consistent details include:
- One (1) watercooler.
- One (1) secretary, of nondescript age, gender, and appearance.
- One (1) couch.
- A number (typically 2-4) of magazines in a language that has yet to be identified or translated.
- A clock that does not tick.

Witnesses describe the experience as excruciatingly boring. Some witnesses experienced a panic attack while in the Waiting Room, due to fears that they would experience eternity inside it.

##### Note
These afterlife states need further research. These six are the most common experiences reported by Agents, however other afterlife states have been observed. As always if suicidal ideation persists after five days please report to your site chaplain as soon as possible.
