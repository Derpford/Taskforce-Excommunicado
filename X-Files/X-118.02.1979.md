A large, condemned mall on the outskirts of Pinehaven, NG. The signage indicates that it was called the "Unicorn Mall" at one point, though our records hold no information on any such corporate entity.

## Notes
This Hazard refers to a series of psychic manifestations which occur in humans who enter the Mall. Subjects affected by this Hazard have immediate, instinctual knowledge of their powers, and are able to use these powers within seconds of setting foot inside the mall. However, all psychic abilities cease functioning as soon as a subject steps *out* of the mall.

After interviewing a number of willing subjects, a pattern has emerged: All subjects describe using a formative memory of some kind as a 'trigger' for their psychic abilities. The contents of the memory have no correlation with the effects of the powers, but the 'strength' of the memory is correlated to the strength of the effect.

Based on testing and exploratory incursions into the Mall, not every subject will have access to all possible hazardous effects.
