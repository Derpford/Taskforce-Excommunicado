Primary branch of the Taskforce Excommunicado TTRPG

The X-Files folder contains data on the weird stuff we've come up with
MAD_DOGS contains the core rules, which are still WIP (MAD_DOGS was the working title before we started integrating it into this setting)
Commonly Reoccuring Entitites Database is for files on stuff like magic, little grey men, and anything where it doesn't make sense to have a file marked with a specific incident date.
