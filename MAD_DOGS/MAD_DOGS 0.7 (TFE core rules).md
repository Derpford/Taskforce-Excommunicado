# Rolling The Dice
The only set of dice needed for this game is a set of two six sided dice and a set of the standard polyhedral dice. 

### The Basic Roll 
Player rolls 2d6 + Skill + Stat, Referee rolls 2d12. Compare the total sum of the 2d6 roll to the face value + Difficulty of the d12s separately. Refer to the chart for resolving the outcome. A roll of 2 will always result in a failure, a roll of 12 will always result in a success.

| 2d6 Doubles | d12 #1 | d12 #2 | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No  | ≤   | ≤   | Failure |
| Yes | ≤   | ≤   | Cost (-1) |
| No  | ≤   | \>  | Cost |
| Yes | ≤   | \>  | Cost (+1) |
| No  | \>  | \>  | Success |
| Yes | \>  | \>  | Crit |

**Failure:** Deal no damage. Enemy **Counter Attack**, Gain a point of stress. 
**Cost:** Succeed at a cost, in combat deal you may make an attack but will do half damage rounded down. The enemy is allowed to **Counter Attack** 
**Success:** You succeed. In combat deal your full amount of damage. **Crit:** You succeed spectacularly, roll your damage and multiply it by two. Gain a point of High.

#### Compare Roll Difficulty Rating

- Trivial: +0 
- Normal: +2 
- Difficult: +4 
- Hard: +6 
- Impossible: +8

# Creating an Agent
### The Basics

Every Agent needs a few things: 
- A name.
- Their age. 
- Their Sex. 
- Their Gender.
- Their Six Stats. 
- Their Health Points (HP). 
- Their Fortitude (FT). 
- Their Assets. 
- Their Stress/High

##### Name
Your character's **Name** is of course what they are names/
##### Sex
**Sex** is your character's biological gender. This has no bearing on ability but may come into play while dealing with anomalies. 
##### Gender
**Gender** is your character's sense of gender identity and may or may not match their sex.
##### Six Stats
Your character's six **Stats** represent your character's overall physical and mental ability.
##### HP
HP represents your characters overall physical and mental health, when this reaches 0 or lower the character will be considered unable to act until their hp returns above 0. Your character's **HP** starts at four (4) HP and adding the score, not the modifier, of your Strength and Agility together and multiplying by two. (HP = 4 + (STR + AGI) \* 2).
##### Fortitude
**Fortitude** represents your character's resilience in deflecting or absorbing damage. It functions to reduce the amount of damage taken from incoming attacks. Each point of Fortitude decreases incoming damage by one hit point (HP). When Fortitude successfully blocks all incoming damage, it decreases by one point until reaching zero (0). Fortitude fully replenishes after a Long Rest or partially replenishes by half (rounded down) after a Short Rest.

To calculate your character's Fortitude, begin with zero (0), then add the total score (not the modifier) of your Luck and Agility. Finally, divide the sum by two and round down to the nearest whole number (Fortitude = (Luck + Agility) / 2).
##### Assets
This represents your total amount of money. Roll 2d12 \* 100 for your initial Assets. 
##### Stress & High
**Stress & High:** Stress and High represent the current mental state of your character. For each point of Stress a -1 penalty is applied to any rolls, for each point of high a +1 bonus is applied. These two can cancel each other out, however you may have up to five points of stress and only three points of high. High resets at the end of each day, however stress does not. You can subtract one point of stress per each long rest OR you may burn a point of high to remove stress.

### Stats 
Each character has six stats, Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Education, Influence, and Luck. These base.

| Stat | Influence |
| --- | --- |
| Strength | HP, Melee Attacks, Physical Skills. |
| Agility | Ranged Attacks, Acrobatics Skills. |
| Intelligence | Technical Attacks, Technical Skills. |
| Education | Survival Skills, Academic Skills. |
| Influence | Social Skills, Command Skills |
| Luck | Used for non-standard skills. |

Stats start at level 1 and go up to level 20. Your stat bonus increases by one (1) for every five (5) points allocated into the skill. The average skill level is 5-9, anything below 5 counts as a -1 penalty.

| Level | Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 1-4 | \-1 |
| 5-9 | ±0  |
| 10-14 | +1  |
| 15-19 | +2  |
| 20+ | +3  |

### Assigning Stats
Roll 2d6 six (6) times, assign the rolls to each stat in any order. Alternatively you may assign 24 points across each of the skills. 
### Luck 
In the event that a player is called to roll for a skill while they are still at the Novice (0) level, rather than applying the skill bonus the player will apply their Luck Bonus. 
### Skills 
Every character will start with sixteen (16) skill points which they will assign to the following skills. Skill levels go from 0 to 5. Novice (0), Apprentice (1), Journeyman (2), Craftsman (3), Artisan (4), Master (5). Each skill level gives +1 to rolls made using the skill up to +5. For each category there are four slots for custom skills. If a skill you think your character should have is not on the list talk this over with the referee during character creation to add a custom skill.

| Physical     | Acrobatics | Technical | Academic    | Survival     | Humanities   | Social       | Command      |

|              |            |           |             |              |              |              |              |
|              |            |           |             |              |              |              |              |
|              |            |           |             |              |              |              |              |

### Stress / High

During the course of the game characters will accrue points of Stress and High, for each point of Stress a character has they apply a -1 to the result of their rolls. Stress can be cured by burning a point of High. For each point of High burned the character loses 1 stress. A point of high can be burned at any time to add +1 to a roll for each point spent. For each point of stress a character gains over 3 they lose 1 HP and the stress will reset to 3. Players can have up to 5 High.

# Combat
## Spaces, Movement & Turns 
##### Spaces 
A **Space** is a square or hexagon taking up 5 ft. A character does not necessarily take up the entire 5 foot square rather it is the space that they reliably control. 
##### Movement 
Characters may move 6 + Agility Bonus spaces in a turn. 
##### Turns 
Combat is split into two turns, the player round and the opponent round. The players all act within a single turn, which order is up to the players. The players will always act first, then the opponents. During a turn a player may take their movement and make one attack if able. 
## Cover & Half Cover 
During the course of combat players will find themselves under attack. During their turn the players may choose to move behind obstacles. If a character is covered from sight above their head from the perspective of an opponent they are in complete cover and cannot take damage. If a character is covered from the waist down and could reasonable duck behind the object they are in half cover and will take 1/2 incoming damage. 
## Healing & Resting 
###### Short Rests 
During a Short Rest a player regains 1d6 + LCK HP and 1 fortitude per hour spent resting. For each hour of rest have a player roll 1d6 + LCK, if the result is four (4) or below the rest is interrupted. 
###### Long Rests 
During a Long Rest a player regains their full HP and FT. This is assumed to take 24 hours of uninterrupted rest in a Safe Location such as a town, outpost, or other non wilderness locations.

# Death
When an Agent's hit points reach 0, they experience temporary demise, swiftly followed by resurrection. Thanks to a blend of cutting-edge medical advancements and the utilization of anomalous phenomena, death becomes a negligible concern for DPI and TFE operatives. Rest assured, the agency values the unique skills and expertise each agent contributes, ensuring their return to duty.

However, this reassurance doesn't extend to the quality of one's afterlife. The experience of death and the subsequent interlude in the beyond may prove unsettling. Upon revival, agents should prepare for a reset: set stress to 5 and high to 0. Then, roll a d6 to ascertain the nature of their afterlife experience.

| 1d6 | Effect                    |
| --- | ------------------------- |
| 1   | **The Eternal Ballroom**  |
| 2   | **The Library of Almina** |
| 3   | **The White Halls**       |
| 4   | **The Forest**            |
| 5   | **The Farms**             |
| 6   | **The Waiting Room**      |
### The Eternal Ballroom
Within the Eternal Ballroom, shimmering chandeliers cast dancing shadows upon marble floors, and the echoes of laughter fill the air perpetually. Yet, amidst the grandeur, there's an unsettling sense of stagnation, as guests twirl in a timeless waltz, unable to remember their arrival or envision an exit. The allure of the dance is ever-present, masking a subtle desperation to escape the eternal revelry.

### The Library of Almina 
Within the Library of Almina, shelves stretch infinitely in all directions, laden with tomes that contain the knowledge of countless universes. Here, one may immerse themselves in the pursuit of understanding, losing track of time amidst the whispers of ancient texts and the scent of parchment. Yet, for all its allure, there's an underlying solitude, a reminder that even amidst infinite knowledge, one may still feel profoundly alone.

### The White Halls
The White Halls offer a serene tapestry of domestic scenes, weaving together fragments of childhood memories and mundane familiarity. Each hallway and room holds echoes of nostalgia, inviting occupants to linger amidst the comforting familiarity of half-remembered spaces. Yet, beneath the veneer of warmth, there's a subtle disquiet, a sense that these memories may be more fragile than they appear.

### The Forest
Within the endless expanse of the Forest, verdant canopies stretch as far as the eye can see, untouched by the hand of man. Here, the primal beauty of nature reigns supreme, inviting wanderers to lose themselves amidst the whispering leaves and dappled sunlight. Yet, amidst the tranquility, there's an undercurrent of primal unease, a reminder of the wild and untamed forces that dwell within.

### The Farms
Amidst the rolling fields and scattered towns of the Farms, civilization flourishes in an idyllic tableau of domestic life. Here, friendly faces and familiar routines offer solace to weary souls, inviting them to embrace the simple pleasures of community and camaraderie. Yet, beneath the facade of warmth, there's a lingering sense of complacency, a subtle temptation to surrender to the comforts of an unchanging existence.

### The Waiting Room
In the Waiting Room, time stretches infinitely as occupants await their turn amidst rows of empty chairs and flickering fluorescent lights. Here, the bureaucratic trappings of the afterlife lend a sense of surreal mundanity to the proceedings, as souls linger in a state of limbo, their fate uncertain and their patience tested. Yet, amidst the tedium, there's a faint glimmer of hope, a reminder that even in the most banal of settings, there may still be a chance for redemption or escape.

##### Note
These afterlife states need further research. These six are the most common experiences reported by Agents, however other afterlife states have been observed. As always if suicidal ideation persists after five days please report to your site chaplain as soon as possible.
